From John N6API:

This Case is designed to enclose the ESP32 PCB Rev 2b.  It is also designed for the 3.2" TFT Display.
There are three parts to the enclosure.
There is a Bottom Piece that contains the PCB.
There is a Top Piece that encloses the PCB.
There is a Display Bezel.  The Bezel is made to be spot glued when you get it in the position you desire,
The three pieces were created on Tinkercad.
