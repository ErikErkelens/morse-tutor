# Morse-Tutor

An inexpensive device for learning Morse Code, using STM32F103C "Blue Pill" microcontroller board, 2.2" ILI9341 TFT, rotary encoder, and piezo element.

Based on "Morse Code Tutor" by Jack Purdum W8TEE.

Full description and 8-part tutorial available at w8bh.net

Folders in this project: "MorseTutor" contains the latest source code. "Tutorials" contains sketches for the 8-part tutorial.  "Troubleshooting" has sketches for hardware validation (screen, encoder, etc).  "KI4PSR-PCB" is code for KI4PSR's printed circuit board, and "Book texts" contains ASCII text for a few classic books.  Put them on your SD card for code practice.
