This release are the necessary files to create a case for Bruce Hall's Morse Code Tutors.  There are 2 cases in this release.  The Folder Square contains all the Objects created from TinkerCad for the case for the ESP32 based PCB with a 3.2" TFT Display with access to the SD slot.

There are the Object Files and in the GCODE directory are the gcode files that can be loaded directly into the 3d printer.  I have tested these gcode files on a Creality Ender-3 Pro.

The Folder Rectangle contains all the Objects created from TinkerCad for the case for the STM32(Blue Pill) based PCB with a 2.2" TFT Display with access to the SD slot.
