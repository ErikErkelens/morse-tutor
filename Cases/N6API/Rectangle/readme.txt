This is the README file for the MCT Case for the Rectangular PCB.  It is designed for the 2.2 inch TFT display with SD socket.  The Case has access holes for all Jacks in the back of the Case. I am designing the rectangular case for larger displays.  Those will be released as soon as they are finalized. 

The bezel that goes along with the case is designed to be glued into place but is not required.  It does cover the edges of the TFT and fits well on the case.  There are two different bezels for your use.  Maybe you want to print your own bezel - That is great also.

The case was designed with TinkerCad and Sliced with Cura.  I used all defaults of Cura to Slice the parts of the case.  It was printed using a Creality Ender-3 Pro.  No Special settings in Cura.  Infill was set to 20%,  No Supports are needed.

Have Fun!  If you have any questions - Feel free to email me at johnbahun@gmail.com

Best of Luck
