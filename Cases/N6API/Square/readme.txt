This is the README file for the MCT Case for the Square PCB.  It is designed for the 3.2 inch TFT display with SD socket.  The Case has access holes for all Jacks in the back of the Case.  It also has a hole on the side for access to the USB connection to the ESP32.  With careful use of a screwdriver, the two push buttons on the ESP32 can also be accessed.

The bezel that goes along with the case is designed to be glued into place but is not required.  It does cover the edges of the TFT and fits well on the case.

The case was designed with TinkerCad and Sliced with Cura.  I used all defaults of Cura to Slice the parts of the case.  It was printed using a Creality Ender-3 Pro.  No Special settings in Cura.  Infill was set to 20%,  No Supports are needed.

Have Fun!  If you have any questions - Feel free to email me at johnbahun@gmail.com

Best of Luck
