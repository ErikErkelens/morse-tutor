These are the STL files to create a case for Bruce Hall's STM32(Blue Pill) Morse Code Tutor 
with a 2.2" TFT Display with access to the SD slot. There is one case bottom with two top styles.
These files were created with FreeCad. 

The CaseTopStyle1.stl is for builds with the MCU mounted on headers. The CaseTopStyle2.stl is 
for the builds with the MCU soldered to the board.   

There are photos in the IMAGE directory.
